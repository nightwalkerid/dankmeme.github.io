<p>Hi, I'm an independent science journalist based in India. My work has appeared in <em>Discover</em>, <em>Science News</em>, <em>The Open Notebook</em>, <em>The Wire</em>, <em>Undark</em>, among other publications.</p>
<p>I was awarded the EurekAlert! Fellowship for International Science Reporters in 2020. I am also a recipient of the S. Ramaseshan Fellowship awarded by the Indian Academy of Sciences. </p>
<p>I cover stories about medicine and public health, ecology, and science policy. I'm interested in understanding the impact of research and science policy on society and the ethical and moral questions in such work. If you'd like to chat or say hi, drop me an email.</p>
